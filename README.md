## Abstract 

Bioassessments have formed the foundation of
many water quality monitoring programs throughout the
United States. Like many state water quality programs,
Connecticut has developed a relational database containing
information about species richness, species composition,
relative abundance, and feeding relationships among
macroinvertebrates present in stream and river systems.
Geographic Information Systems can provide estimates of
landscape condition and watershed characteristics and
when combined with measurements of stream biology,
provide a useful visual display of information that is useful
in a management context. The objective of our study was to
estimate the stream health for all wadeable stream kilo-
meters in Connecticut using a combination of macroin-
vertebrate metrics and landscape variables. We developed
and evaluated models using an information theoretic
approach to predict stream health as measured by macro-
invertebrate multimetric index (MMI) and identified the
best fitting model as a three variable model, including
percent impervious land cover, a wetlands metric, and
catchment slope that best fit the MMI scores (adj-
R 2 = 0.56, SE = 11.73). We then provide examples of
how modeling can augment existing programs to support
water management policies under the Federal Clean Water
Act such as stream assessments and anti-degradation.
